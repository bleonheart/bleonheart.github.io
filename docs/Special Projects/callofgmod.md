# Call of GMOD

**Description**:

This project aims to replicate Call of Duty in Garry's Mod, preserving the general aesthetic and gameplay of the universe. There are two teams—Axis and Allies—with either a time limit or a score limit, whichever is reached first. The gamemode comes with preset configurations or, if you prefer, is extremely easy to configure.
