The Black Market NPC module implements an underground contraband trading system that allows players to purchase illegal weapons, items, and contraband through hidden black market dealers. Players must locate secret black market NPCs and can place orders for various illicit goods with realistic import delays, risk mechanics, and delivery systems that encourage exploration and underground roleplay scenarios.
